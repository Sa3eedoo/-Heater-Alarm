# -Heater-Alarm
Consider a boiler in a petrochemical factory. Its temperature is measured every 3 minutes. If the temperature  200ºC, a green led will turn on. If the 200 &lt; temperature &lt; 500ºC, a yellow led will turn on. If the temperature  500ºC, a red led will turn on. Write a program that reads the temperature every 3 minutes and shows the LED condition.
